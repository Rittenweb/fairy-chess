## Fairy Chess

Chess has a long history of variants and home-brewed spinoffs. Traditionally, custom chess pieces with non-traditional movement are known as [fairy pieces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_chess_piece). In this game, you have randomly-given fairy pieces at your command, from a pool of nearly all the historically known and mathemetically possible piece definitions. Use them to fight back oncoming waves of mindless pawns.

### How to Play

To start the game, you'll be randomly given a selcetion of three "common" pieces, two "uncommon" pieces, and one "rare" piece. They are separated by relative power. For example, pawn-like pieces would be common, knight-like pieces would be uncommon, and queen-like pieces would be rare.

Choose the starting placement of your seven pieces. The first two rows of the board are your starting zone.

Pawns will begin to appear at the opposite end of the board. Each turn, you are allowed to move all your pieces once, and on the pawns' turn, all of the pawns will move once. If you are in their capture range, they will capture you. If you lose a piece, you will never get it back.

The goal is to last as long as possible before all your pieces are gone, or the pawns reach your end of the board. Every wave of pawns you fully capture is another point toward your high score.
